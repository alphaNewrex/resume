\begin{rSection}{Research Interests}
    I am passionate about advancing the frontiers of \textbf{distributed training methodologies}, 
    \textbf{federated learning systems}, and \textbf{large language models (LLMs)}. I like to explore  learn about
    innovative techniques for optimizing model training across \textbf{heterogeneous computing environments}, 
    developing \textbf{privacy-preserving} approaches to federated learning, and critically examining 
    the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.\ Additionally, 
    I would love to work and investigate the \textbf{computational optimizations} and \textbf{infrastructure requirements} essential 
    for both training and deploying these sophisticated AI systems at scale in real-world applications.
